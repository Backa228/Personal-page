                    <br>
                    In this project, I started using tools and technologies like Gulp for task automation, SCSS for modular and maintainable
                    styling, and Swiper for creating responsive sliders. I also implemented custom mixins such as adaptiveValue for fluid
                    layouts and toRem for consistent typography, which improved both the responsiveness and scalability of the website’s
                    design.
